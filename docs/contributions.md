OpenCore is an open-source project and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether it's fixing bugs, improving documentation, or proposing new features, your help is valued.

## Contribution Workflow

2.  **Create a Branch**: Work on a specific feature or fix.
3.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Provide a detailed description of your changes.

## Guidelines
- Follow the existing coding style (TypeScript + Biome (linter and format)).
- Ensure all tests pass.
- Update documentation if you are adding new features.
